# Python for data analyst

This project aims to summarize and systematize the essential python skills for data management and analysis, which will not only organize my python knowledge but also be suitable for beginners who want to learn on their own by reading the code. Most of the material is based on the python econometrics course offered by the Department of Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen.
The contents consist of NumPy, Pandas, and basic data visualization with Matplotlib.
